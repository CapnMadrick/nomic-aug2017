# :tada: You are invited to play Nomic! :tada:

Nomic is an interesting game where each move in the game changes the rules of the game, even how you win can be modified. 

This version ofthe game uses Github to keep track of the rules and to facilitate voting and discussion on rule changes. The game is played in a [correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence_chess) fashion, so you only need to check in every few days. There are also rules for going _inactive_ if you can't play for a short period.
